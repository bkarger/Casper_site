      <description>Our laboratroy is apart of the Mycobacteria Research Labs at Colorado State University, Fort Collins CO. We are concerned with possible boosting strategies of the current vaccination provided for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine. As well as environmental effects on the host immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection due to envrionmental, or non-tuberculosis mycobacteria. Due to the complex nature of the bacillus we are constantly altering experimental approaches and methods.</description>
