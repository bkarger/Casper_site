      <description>Our laboratroy is apart of the Mycobacteria Research Labs at Colorado State University, Fort Collins CO. We are concerned with possible boosting strategies of the current vaccination provided for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine. As well as environmental effects on the host immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection due to envrionmental, or non-tuberculosis mycobacteria. Due to the complex nature of the bacillus we are constantly altering experimental approaches and methods.</description>

      <description>The LabPI : Dr. Marcela Henao-Tamayo
Our laboratory is devoted to investigating the pathogenesis and immune response to M. tuberculosis, with a central interest in the nature of memory T cells induced by vaccines [including BCG]. Additionally, we have the unique ability to test how effective these T-cell subsets are against different clinical strains of tuberculosis. As the Director of the CSU Flow Cytometry Core facility, my laboratory has been implementing and developing new analytical tools for 21-color flow cytometry.</description>
