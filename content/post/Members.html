<h1>The Lab</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>PI : Dr. Marcela Henao-Tamayo</p>

<p>Our laboratory is devoted to investigating the pathogenesis and immune response to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, with a central interest in the nature of memory T cells induced by vaccines [including BCG]. Additionally, we have the unique ability to test how effective these T-cell subsets are against different clinical strains of tuberculosis. As the Director of the CSU Flow Cytometry Core facility, my laboratory has been implementing and developing new analytical tools for 21-color flow cytometry. We are currently using algorithms that automatically identify cell populations according to their marker expression profiles. These computational methods not only have the capacity to identify rare populations, but also to match cell populations across samples, and statistically compare features between different populations. These algorithms provide an unsupervised analysis, allowing an unbiased investigation of cytometry data. In addition to flow cytometry, we are excited to begin single cell sequencing as well as metabolomic analysis of immune cells elicited by <em>M. tuberculosis</em> and vaccines.</p>

<p>Post Doctoral Fellow: Dr. Taru Dutt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holds a Ph.D. degree and has 5 years of research experience and 2 years of teaching experience. Ms. Dutt has been working in immunology field since 2012, first as a research associate in Lady Hardinge Medical College where she worked on role of Th1 and Th2 cytokines ratio in infertility under Dr. Pikee Saxena. Later, she joined Ph.D. in 2013 under the guidance of Prof. Rajiv K. Saxena, where she worked on interaction of nanoparticles with the immune system. She had been awarded with National fellowship from Indian Council of Medical Research throughout her Ph.D. She moved to Fort Collins as a post-doctoral fellow in Henao-Tamayo lab, where she started working on vaccine candidates against <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (Mtb). Currently, she is keen to evaluate the effect of non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) on protective efficacy of BCG towards Mtb. Dr. Dutt has 7 years of flow cytometry experience and her interest is to design and perform polychromatic flow cytometry.</p>

<p>PhD Student: Amy Fox</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3rd year graduate student in the Microbiology PhD program at Colorado State University. She received her B.S. in Bioengineering at Rice University while working as a research project intern at Baylor College of Medicine. Her current project in the Henao lab involves evaluating the immune response to tuberculosis vaccine candidates and developing an R-based data analysis pipeline to better analyze and visualize flow cytometry data. She recently received the NSF GAUSSI Fellowship, an transdisciplinary graduate training program in computational biology and analysis of big data. Her expertise includes flow cytometry, Elisa’s, Western blotting, and computational data analysis using R.</p>
