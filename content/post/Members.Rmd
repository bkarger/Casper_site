# The Lab  
  
> PI : Dr. Marcela Henao-Tamayo  
 
> Research Scientist: Dr. Andres Obregon  
  
> Post Doctoral Fellow: Dr. Taru Dutt  
  
Holds a Ph.D. degree and has 5 years of research experience and 2 years of teaching experience. Ms. Dutt has been working in immunology field since 2012, first as a research associate in Lady Hardinge Medical College where she worked on role of Th1 and Th2 cytokines ratio in infertility under Dr. Pikee Saxena. Later, she joined Ph.D. in 2013 under the guidance of Prof. Rajiv K. Saxena, where she worked on interaction of nanoparticles with the immune system and also tried to find out different substances that could work as adjuvants for boosting vaccine immune response with lesser side effects. She had qualified and awarded National fellowship from Indian Council of Medical Research throughout her Ph.D. Her expertise includes Flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, Elisa, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. She is also trained in animal handling and procedures like vaccinations.  

> PhD Student: Amy Fox  
  
3rd year PhD candidate in the Microbiology program at Colorado State University. She received her B.S. in Bioengineering at Rice University while working as a research project intern at Baylor College of Medicine. Her current project in the Henao lab involves evaluating the immune response to tuberculosis vaccine candidates and developing an R-based data analysis pipeline to better analyze and visualize flow cytometry data. She recently received the NSF GAUSSI Fellowship, an transdisciplinary graduate training program in computational biology and analysis of big data. Her expertise includes flow cytometry, Elisaâ€™s, Western blotting, and computational data analysis using R.
