<p>Our laboratory is apart of the Mycobacteria Research Labs at Colorado State University, Fort Collins CO. We are concerned with possible boosting strategies of the current vaccination provided for <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine. As well as environmental effects on the host immune response to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> infection due to envrionmental, or non-tuberculosis mycobacteria. Due to the complex nature of the bacillus we are constantly altering experimental approaches and methods. Dr. Marcela Henao-Tamayo is an expert in Flow Cytometric analysis of host cells for immune profiling. Along with our research scientist, Dr. Andres Obregon-Henao, and post-doctoral fellow, Dr. Taru Dutt, we are robust laboratory for flow cytometric analysis of murine models response to mycobacterial immune responses. Our PhD. student, Amy Fox, is currently developing an R-based data analysis pipeline for processing flow cytometric data associated with any type of cytometer.</p>
